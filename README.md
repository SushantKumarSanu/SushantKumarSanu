# Hi, I’m Sushant Kumar Sanu👋

I’m an **intermediate full-stack developer** with a **strong backend focus**, actively building real-world applications and preparing for **backend / full-stack roles (internship or full-time)**.

I believe in **clarity over hype**, **systems over shortcuts**, and **consistent execution over motivation**.
